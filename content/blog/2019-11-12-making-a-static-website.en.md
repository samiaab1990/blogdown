When I decided to create a static generated website, I started off with Jekyll even though I had been using R, where the `blogdown` package would have likely been easier to navigate. I had seen a volume of .github.io domains, so I figured I'd give Jekyll a try (you can check [this](https://dzone.com/articles/static-site-generators-overview-gatsby-vs-hugo-vs) site out if you want to know more about the differences between common static website generators Jekyll, Hugo and GatsbyJS). 

Technically, you can get started pretty quickly with [Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) and choose one of the themes under the repository settings. Otherwise, [using Github Pages with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) offers more [theme options](https://jekyllthemes.io/).

Welcome and thanks for visiting my blog! I am interested in data science and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology as it relates to public health and clinical decision making. Within these domains, I am also thinking about social determinants of health and the historical and social contexts that lead to disparities. I am interested in learning new things, which has been my main motivation to keep this blog as a "notebook" and hope it can be a helpful tool for those who share similar interests. 

My current work is in health policy and access of care.

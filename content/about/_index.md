title: About

Welcome and thanks for visiting my blog! I am interested in data science and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology as it relates to public health and clinical decision making. These interests are generally within the the realm of policy, environmental, pharmaco and clinical epidemiology though I am always interested in learning new things, which has been my main motivation to keep this blog as a "notebook" and hope it can be a helpful tool for those who share similar interests. Within the aforementioned domains, I am also thinking about social determinants of health and the historical and social contexts that lead to disparities.

My current work is in health policy and access of care.

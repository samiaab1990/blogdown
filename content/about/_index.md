Welcome and thanks for visiting my blog! I am a public health professional with experiences in healthcare and clinical research interested in all things epidemiology and biostatistics related. I started learning a little bit (like really little bit) of programming using python and R but then transitioned to STATA after being formally trained in biostatistics with it during graduate school. I stuck with STATA afterward for some time while simultaneously learning more R and currently use R and SAS most frequently. 

I made this blog as a way to document my learning experience with these different programs, primarily the open-source ones and share other projects and stuff I've learned along the way.

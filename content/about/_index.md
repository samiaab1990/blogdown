Welcome and thanks for visiting my blog! I am interested in data science and methods in biostatistics and epidemiology as it relates to public health and clinical research. Within these domains, I am also thinking about determinants of health and the historical and social contexts that lead to disparities. I created this blog as a way of keeping a notebook as I learn new things in and hope it can be a helpful tool for those who share similar interests. 

My current work is in health policy and access of care.

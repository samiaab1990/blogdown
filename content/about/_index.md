Welcome and thanks for visiting my blog! I am a public health professional with experiences in healthcare and clinical research interested in all things clinical, epidemiology and biostatistics related. I made this blog to document my interests as well as learning experiences with different statistical programs, primarily the open-source ones and share other projects I've learned along the way.
